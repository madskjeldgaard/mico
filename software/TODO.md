- Setup gpio irq outside of class?
- Double check that max value is reachable (it isn't)
- Properly clamp values under 0 in the encoder itself.
- save options in flash: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/flash/program/flash_program.c
- MICOencoder:
	- Encoder seems to start at random point (at least when received in SC?)
	- Remove all the microstep leftovers from pio-encoder
- Move encoder stuff to seperate library
